# react-otp
Developed a customizable one-time password (OTP) component built with React. The component allows users to enter OTPs, which are short, numeric codes that are typically sent to the user's phone or email address. The component can be customized to match the look and feel of the website, and it can also be added features such as auto-focus and auto-fill.
